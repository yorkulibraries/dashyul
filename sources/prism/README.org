* About

The York University Bookstore has given us access to a limited view in Prism (their inventory management system) where we can pull a list of all course textbooks and required readings.  This can be exported to an Excel file, and a script here will convert that into a more usable CSV file.

* Make targets

+ ~make~ :: process the raw bookstore Prism file.
+ =make push_data= :: push the CSV data file up to production (so the EStuTTe script can be run there)

* Scripts

** ~process-prism-data.R~

Uses:

This is run manually as needed, so there is no cron job.
